HSP Energy
=========

Hardware project of HS Regensburg

This project of Embedded Systems Laboratory of HS Regensburg 
aims to work out rules and guidelines for energy-effective coding
for different uC families.

There is a base board for, where DC-DC, debugger and USB-UART converter are located, 
and CPU boards for different microcontrollers.
Schematic and layout of base board will be added ASAP.

Documentation will be added when ready.

Scematics and layouts made in EagleCAD 6. 
All hardware involved is open and available under terms of BSD license.
